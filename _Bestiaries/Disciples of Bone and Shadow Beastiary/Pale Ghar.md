description: "These lizards can grow to the size of a horse and use their dark, slick skin to hide in the shadows, waiting for the perfect opportunity to pounce over their unsuspecting prey. If their sharp fangs and claws aren't enough to finish a fight quickly, usually their poison finishes the job sooner or later."
