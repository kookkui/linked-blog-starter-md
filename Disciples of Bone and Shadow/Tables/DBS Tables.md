| 1          | **Lost**. It would appear you've been walking in circles, making no progress whatsoever. You reach no Milestone and must start again from where you initiated today's journey, having wasted the day                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 2          | **Battlefield**. It appears that a fight between two relatively large groups took place here. Unfortunately, there are some traps set all over the place that have not been triggered. You move at a slow pace (10 miles/day) in order to avoid the traps                                                                                                                              |
| 3          | **Landslide**. The ground suddenly shifts under your feet, causing you to stumble and fall into the gap under your feet. Perform a DEX (-2) test or lose D6 HP due to the fall 4 Blocked. The road or path ahead is blocked, forcing you to find an alternative route. Add an extra 10 miles to your journey                                                                           |
| 5          | **River**. You had no option but to cross a river that was in your way, but in doing so you lost D4 rations that were totally ruined or dragged away by the current                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
| 6          | **Flash Flood**. A downpour upstream seems to have triggered a flash flood. Fortunately for you though you saw it coming on time and managed to tie yourself to a tree. Unfortunately, though you lost a random piece of gear, dragged away by the flood                                                                                                                               |
| 7          | **Crossed a Threshold**. It seems that you've somehow crossed a Threshold without realizing it. You have no recollection of what happened the past 20 hours, but you arrive at your destination safe and sound, aside from some singed clothes and getting there a day late 8 Overgrowth. The path ahead is overgrown with vines, grass and twisted bushes, reducing your pace to Slow |
| 9          | **Restless dead**. In order to avoid a horde of restless dead roaming the path ahead of you, you must make a detour around them. Add an extra 10 miles to your journey                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
|10          | **Drained vitality**. You wander into a patch of land that seems to be affected by some powerful death magic, draining the life of anyone or anything crossing it. You arrive at your destination crawling, fatigued beyond anything you've ever experienced. You are unable to eat or set camp for the night, going straight to sleep|

| 2           | **Trapdoor.** Characters must successfully pass a DEX Test or lose D10 HP. If the whole party falls inside, they will need a rope to escape the pit, or they will die of starvation inside of it.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |
| 3           | **Sand Trap.** A wall closes behind the characters as soon as they enter this room, and sand begins falling in from the ceiling. The party has a combined 10 attempts at deactivating this trap with the Disarm Traps skill or by successfully passing a DEX (-6) Test, or they all die.                                                                                                                                         |

| 5           | **Noxious Gas.** A wall closes behind the party, and toxic gas is released in the room. Characters immediately lose 2 HP, and they lose another 1 HP each time they fail to disable the trap using the Disarm Traps skill or a DEX (-6) Skill Test until a successful attempt is made, disabling the trap.                                                                                                                       |
| 6           | **Spears.** Sharp spears slide from the walls, stabbing at any character who fails to pass a DEX Test. They are targeted by D6 attacks that deal 2 damage each.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 7           | **Vermin Pit.** A pit opens underneath the characters, teeming with vermin. The characters must succeed on a DEX Test or lose D10 HP, after which they will face the vermin inside. Roll on the Vermin Table. Luckily, once the vermin are dealt with, it's not too difficult to climb back up.                                                                                                                                  |
| 8           | **Bear Trap.** A random character steps on a hidden bear trap. Roll a DEX Test to avoid getting caught in it. A trapped character must succeed on a STR Test to free themselves, or else they will suffer D10 damage and are unable to move. One attempt per character is allowed. If the trapped character manages to be released, they will have their Dodge Skill halved until all damage caused by the trap has been healed. |
| 9           | **Net Trap.** A net falls from the ceiling, pulling the characters into the air unless they pass a DEX Test. If they are trapped, they must roll a successful DEX (-5) Test to cut down the net. After each failed release attempt, roll a D10. On a 1 or 2 a wandering enemy hears the commotion, and attacks. The characters will be automatically hit (no Parrying allowed) by the enemy until they can free themselves.      |
| 10          | **Fire Trap.** Huge flames roar from the walls the moment the characters step into this room. Roll a DEX Test to avoid the flames or lose D10 HP and gain the Burning condition. You fight with a -20 to your attack skills until the wounds caused by the fire are healed.                                                                                                                                                      |
