| 6-7        | **Cave**. A half-visible trail leads the party to a seemingly natural cave. If the party decides to explore it, use the Indoor Location generation rules                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| 8-9        | **Ruins**. You come across the abandoned remnants of a bygone era. If you choose to explore it use the Indoor Location generation rules                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| 10-11      | **Settlement**. You stumble upon a small community. Use the Settlement rules found on page 83                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 12         | **Noble Hunter**. As you walk through the vast planes, sprinkled here and there by farmland and cattle, a splash of color draws your attention. A few feet further ahead you find a corpse, dressed in luxurious red and yellow clothes. It's been here for a while now, as it doesn't even smell. Beside it, you find a well crafted wooden bow, and inside a leather quiver a single, iron-tipped arrow. This arrow deals +10 extra damage                                                                                                                                                             |
| 13         | **Justice**. The smell of smoke is the first thing you notice before you can see, not that further away, the light of a big fire illuminating the dark sky. As you approach it, you get a better idea of what's going on: a regiment of Dusk Blades are surrounding a village, setting ablaze all the houses there. The villagers are all standing outside the village, staring at the soldiers as their houses are destroyed. If you ask around, you learn that apparently the village was built without an official permit and therefore it had no right to be built there                             |
| 14         | **Abandoned Farmstead**. Although the region has seen many new farms appear in order to feed the increasing population of Madari, this one over here seems to have been abandoned not that long ago. Crops are overgrown by weeds and thorns, and some of the fences have already been torn down by wild animals. As you walk through the field you arrive at its center, where a half disinterred marble statue of a cadaveric man lies. A sense of dread invades you when you approach it, and you can see a few farming tools surrounding it as if the farmers had simply dropped it all and ran away |
| 15         | **Flower Field**. Flowers of all colors and shapes grow here, with many that you have never seen before. If you search for useful plants you'll find 2D10 doses instead of the regular D10                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 16         | **Hangman Tree**. A single tree stands in the middle of a field, its branches creaking by the weight of three bodies hanging from them, in different stages of decomposition. All bodies have been branded on the forehead with the sigil of Danag the Silent                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 17         | **The Clearfelling**. As you cross one of the few forested areas around Madari, you find an opening caused by someone having fallen dozens of trees, judging by all the tree stumps. In the middle of the clearing though, a single, ancient-looking tree stands tall, its lush branches waiving slightly due to the breeze. Hanging from the tree you find D20 pieces of fruit; each piece counts as a day's ration                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 18         | **Burial Mound**. A single, imposing burial mound stands in front of you, with a tunnel allowing you to access it. Upon closer inspection, it is clear the tunnel was dug from the inside out, and once inside your suspicions are confirmed as you find no corpse whatsoever. Instead, you find a single, dead raven, placed where the corpse once was, its wings spread wide. You also find several almost worthless little gems and amulets, for a total of 50 jats                                                                                                                                   |
| 19         | **Travelers**. A group of travelers is ahead in the road, their belongings hauled on the back of overworked horses and donkeys. One of them notices you and warns the others, who stand and stare at you with suspicion. They have nothing to share but their story: a great beast came and destroyed their little house, which was the last straw for the family elder, who decided the family would find a better fortune in the streets of Madari                                                                                                                                                     |
| 20         | **Rift**. As you advance through this quiet and gloomy land, dark thoughts in your mind, a sudden burst of light startles you. A few feet away the air seems to be shimmering with a bright but at the same time dark light; as the light spreads, advancing in a way that reminds you of blood seeping from an open wound, a set of monstrous tentacles burst from within it, attempting to grab you. You must succeed at 3 DEX test; for each one you fail you are dragged closer to the rift, which closes after 5 attempts, the tentacles disappearing on the other side with you or without you     |

Use the Settlement rules found on page 83                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| 12         | **Tree**. A single, twisted tree stands on top of a small hill ahead. When you approach it, its vibrant red flowers immediately draw your attention; their intense fragrance captivates you almost as much as their bright color, giving you a sensation of peace and belonging                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| 13         | **Nest**. Woven with tree trunks and large vines, a nest big enough to hold several people rests against a small rock formation ahead of you. Approaching it with caution, you find the remains of three enormous eggs, cracked shell pieces flooring the nest's bottom. Perform a Perception skill test, if you succeed you find DIO precious gemstones worth 5O jats each scattered between the shells                                                                                                                                                   |
| 14         | **Open Burial Site**. In front of you lies a large slab of polished stone, surrounded by now extinguished bonfires. On top of it, you see the remains of several individuals, all of them partially mummified but still wearing traditional Blackclay garments and jewelry. This is holy ground for the blackclay tribes, and somehow not even the wild beasts seem to have approached the corpses. You may choose to loot the bodies, for a total of DIOxIOO jats                                                                                         |
| 15         | **Pool** of Liquid Metal. As you approach what looks like a volcanic vent, you hear the boiling and gurgling sound of a liquid. As you peer down the steep hole, you cannot believe what you see: a small lake of what appears to be pure liquid metal. There's enough here to shame the fortune of Danag himself! Getting down there and getting some of it out would be problematic, though...                                                                                                                                                           |
| 16         | **Fog**. A sudden bank of fog surrounds you, quickly slowing your pace. For some strange reason though you start feeling extremely drowsy, to the point where you're having serious trouble keeping your eyes open. Pass a WIL test, otherwise, you fall asleep right on the spot and wake up a day later, tired and wet but with the fog nowhere to be seen                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| 17         | **Hallowed Land**. As you enter this patch of land, without any special features to distinguish it from the rest, you immediately feel as if a huge weight had been lifted from your shoulders. Your mind is clear and the world seems a bit brighter. Any spell casting here causes no corruption                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| 18         | **Caravan**. Ahead of you, you see what seems like the remains of a caravan. The carts are all covered with a fine layer of volcanic ash. Surrounding it, you find the skeletal remains of all the animals and humans that belonged to the caravan. Small, black spiders scurry about them, but no clear signs of violence are visible                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| 19         | **The Hag**. As you make progress through these lonely lands, you interrupt yourself when you see an old woman sitting by, looking at you. You approach her and she simply smiles at you and starts telling you about her lost nephew. For some reason you feel obliged to listen to her, but as her story progresses you start to feel uncomfortable, shadows flickering around you. Perform a WIL test, if you fail you earn 2 CP, but gain 2 points in Forbidden Lore. Either way, you pass out and when you wake up five minutes later the hag is gone |
| 20         | **Goat Herd**. Even before you can see them, you hear them right ahead; the unmistakable balling of goats, in the hundreds. In the middle of the herd, a single man and his dog stand, walking peacefully. If you approach him and pass a CHA test he will offer you guidance, allowing you to ignore the next negative result from a hex                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
