|`dice:D20`|MADARI HEX EXPLORATION|
|1-5|Encounter. Roll on the Madari Encounter table|
|6-7|Cave. A half-visible trail leads the party to a seemingly natural cave. If the  <br>  <br>party decides to explore it, use the Indoor Location generation rules|
|8-9|Ruins. You come across the abandoned remnants of a bygone era. If you  <br>  <br>choose to explore it use the Indoor Location generation rules|
|10-11|Settlement. You stumble upon a small community. Use the Settlement  <br>  <br>rules found on page  83|
|12|Noble Hunter. As you walk through the vast planes, sprinkled here and  <br>  <br>there by farmland and cattle, a splash of color draws your attention. A few  <br>  <br>feet further ahead you find a corpse, dressed in luxurious red and yellow  <br>  <br>clothes. It's been here for a while now, as it doesn't even smell. Beside it,  <br>  <br>you find a well crafted wooden bow, and inside a leather quiver a single,  <br>  <br>iron-tipped arrow. This arrow deals +IO extra damage|
|13|Justice. The smell of smoke is the first thing you notice before you can  <br>  <br>see, not that further away, the light of a big fire illuminating the dark sky.  <br>  <br>As you approach it, you get a better idea of what's going on: a regiment of  <br>  <br>Dusk Blades are surrounding a village, setting ablaze all the houses there.  <br>  <br>The villagers are all standing outside the village, staring at the soldiers as  <br>  <br>their houses are destroyed. If you ask around, you learn that apparently  <br>  <br>the village was built without an official permit and therefore it had no  <br>  <br>right to be built there|
|14|Abandoned Farmstead. Although the region has seen many new farms  <br>  <br>appear in order to feed the increasing population of Madari, this one over  <br>  <br>here  seems  to  have  been  abandoned  not  that  long  ago.  Crops  are  <br>  <br>overgrown by weeds and thorns, and some of the fences have already  <br>  <br>been torn down by wild animals. As you walk through the field you arrive  <br>  <br>at its center, where a half disinterred marble statue of a cadaveric man  <br>  <br>lies. A sense of dread invades you when you approach it, and you can see  <br>  <br>a few farming tools surrounding it as if the farmers had simply dropped  <br>  <br>it all and ran away|
|15|Flower Field. Flowers of all colors and shapes grow here, with many that  <br>  <br>you have never seen before. If you search for useful plants you'll find  <br>  <br>2DIO doses instead of the regular DIO|
|16|Hangman Tree. A single tree stands in the middle of a field, its branches  <br>  <br>creaking by the weight of three bodies hanging from them, in different  <br>  <br>stages of decomposition. All bodies have been branded on the forehead  <br>  <br>with the sigil of Danag the Silent|
|17|The Clearfelling. As you cross one of the few forested areas around Madari, you find an opening caused by someone having fallen dozens of trees, judging by all the tree stumps. In the middle of the clearing though, a single, ancient-looking tree stands tall, its lush branches waiving slightly due to the breeze. Hanging from the tree you find D2O pieces of fruit; each piece counts as a day's ration|
|18|Burial Mound. A single, imposing burial mound stands in front of you, with a tunnel allowing you to access it. Upon closer inspection, it is clear the tunnel was dug from the inside out, and once inside your suspicions are confirmed as you find no corpse whatsoever. Instead, you find a single, dead raven, placed where the corpse once was, its wings spread wide. You also find several almost worthless little gems and amulets, for a total of 5O jats|
|19|Travelers. A group of travelers is ahead in the road, their belongings hauled on the back of overworked horses and donkeys. One of them notices you and warns the others, who stand and stare at you with suspicion. They have nothing to share but their story: a great beast came and destroyed their little house, which was the last straw for the family elder, who decided the family would find a better fortune in the streets of Madari|
|20|Rift. As you advance through this quiet and gloomy land, dark thoughts in your mind, a sudden burst of light startles you. A few feet away the air seems to be shimmering with a bright but at the same time dark light; as the light spreads, advancing in a way that reminds you of blood seeping from an open wound, a set of monstrous tentacles burst from within it, attempting to grab you. You must succeed at 3 DEX test; for each one you fail you are dragged closer to the rift, which closes after 5 attempts, the tentacles disappearing on the other side with you or without you|
