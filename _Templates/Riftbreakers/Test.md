#### Class Abilities

```

**Alertness:** Reduces by one (-1) on a d6 roll  the party’s chance to be *surprized*.

**Ambusher:** When traversing the wilds alone or with others of like ability, the ranger’s base surprize chance increases by one (+1) on a d6 roll. Furthermore, when outdoors, even an untrained party’s chance to surprize increases by one (+1) if the ranger positions and prepares them accordingly.

**Climb:** To ascend or descend sheer cliffs or walls without need of climbing gear, if lightly armoured or unarmoured, as a thief of equal level (level 1 - **9:12**). Chance in-twelve reduced by 4 if wearing medium armour; impossible in heavy armour. If vertical, the surface must be rough or cracked. At least one check must be made per 100 feet of climbing. Failure indicates the climber has slipped and fallen at about the midpoint of the check.

**Discern Noise:** Unusually perceptive, detecting the faintest sounds. The ranger can discern noise as a thief of equal level (level 1 - **4:12**). Six rounds (one minute) of concentrated listening are required.

**Hide:** If lightly armoured or unarmoured, able to hide outdoors (wilderness) as a thief of equal level (level 1 - **6:12**), lurking behind bushes, rocks, trees, and the like. Chance-in-twelve reduced by 4 if wearing medium armour; impossible in heavy armour. A ranger can employ camouflage or remain perfectly still whilst flattened to the ground. Only the slightest movement is permissible (e.g., unsheathing a blade, opening a pouch). Hiding is impossible in direct sunlight, or if the ranger is observed. In non-wilderness areas (e.g., cities, dungeons), the chance-in-twelve is decreased by 2.

**Move Silently:** To stalk like a panther, moving with preternatural quiet, comparable to a thief of equal level (level - **6:12**), if the ranger is lightly armoured or unarmoured. Chance-in-twelve reduced by 4 if wearing medium armour; impossible in heavy armour. This skill is executed at half the ranger’s normal movement rate.

**Otherworldly Enemies:** From their earliest training (typically aged 10–12), rangers are awakened to the terrible knowledge of malevolent alien beings and the nameless horrors they represent. Through painstaking instruction and supernatural insight rangers can cognize the most effective means to harm the otherworldly. Rangers become uncannily perspicacious to these creatures; consequently, they inflict +1 hp damage per level of experience versus the abominations that are categorized as “otherworldly.”

--- column-end ---

**Track:** To stalk prey, tracing physical signs and discerning subtle clues. A ranger can track at the below suggested probabilities: 
- Wilderness: A base 10-in-12 chance to find, identify, and follow fresh tracks outdoors or in natural caverns. 
 - Non-Wilderness: A base 3-in-12 chance to discern tracks in a dungeon, castle, city street, or like setting. 

Furthermore, the ranger can identify in general terms the species tracked if it is a known animal type (e.g., a large feline, a heavy bovine, a small canine). N.B.: The referee may adjust the chance-in-twelve to track based on prevailing circumstances.

**Track Concealment:** In the wilderness, obscure the tracks of a number of companions equal to the ranger’s level of experience; however, maximum speed is restricted to half the ranger’s normal movement rate (MV).

**Traverse Overgrowth:** Negotiate natural overgrowth (e.g., briars, brush, tangles, thorns, vines) at normal movement rate (MV), without leaving a discernible trail (if so desired). The ranger cannot perform this skill wearing heavy armour.

**Weapon Mastery:** Mastery of one weapon (+1 “to hit” and +1 damage). Additional weapons may be mastered at 4th, 8th, and 12th levels. As noted in Chapter 6: Equipment, the attack rate for melee weapons and the rates of fire for most missile weapons improve through weapon mastery. For more information on weapon mastery, see Chapter 9: Combat, weapon skill.

**Wilderness Survival:** Hunting, trapping, fishing, boating, shelter building, fire building (including tribal smoke signals), logging, woodworking, raft building, and so on. These tasks are performed without need of a check; they are simply the ranger’s province. Under adverse conditions, the referee may assign a reasonable probability of success. Whether a chance of failure applies is at the discretion of the referee, as reflected by the prevailing conditions and abilities of the ranger.
